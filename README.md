A little game about Game of Thrones

This is a game about the TV show, Game of Thrones.

It's written in java processing, I plan to add at least a few more modes, and potentially a difficulty setting, and make it a little bit more visually appealing.

There is currently only 1 mode, whitewalker assault in which the player tries to survive for as long as possible, killing as many whitewalkers as possible. My current high score is 198 ... try to beat me :^)

Controls:

Left arrow = move left

Right arrow = move right

Spacebar = Jump (currently not very useful to player)

Click = attack
